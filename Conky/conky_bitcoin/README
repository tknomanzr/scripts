Depends:
electrum
conky-all

show_bitcoin is a simple python script that levarages information
from an electrum wallet, along with current bit coin pricing to
format and print out the amount of bitcoin in the wallet, the current
price for bitcoing and the current estimated fiat currency value of 
the bitcoin stored in the electrum wallet.

Useage: Assuming the script is stored in ~/bin then issue
${execpi 60 ~/bin/show_bitcoin}
into your conky.

TO DO:
add an arg parser.
function out current_price, btc_balance, approximate_value, so they can be optionally shown.
Add a function thst will allow the json history from coinbase to be output to conky as a graph.
