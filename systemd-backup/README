Dependencies:
ssh
rsync
systemd

Useage:
copy systemd-backup.service and systemd-backup.timer to /etc/systemd/system
edit backup excludes and replace all the /home/ entries with your $HOME.
copy backup-excludes to ~/.config/backup
edit backup.
Enter the username and ip adress of your remote host.
Finally enter the path relative to your remote host that you want to backup to.
Copy this file to /usr/local/bin
Start systemd-backup.service and systemd-backup.timer
sudo systemctl start systemd-backup.timer
sudo systemctl start systemd-backup.service

Notes:
- For automatic backups see ssh-agent, ssh-add and x11-ssh-askpass or gnome-ssh-askpass.
- You can adjust the settings in systemd-backup.timer and set a lower value,
  say 5 minutes in order to verify that everything is working.
- Verify the service files are working via journalctl -xf
- Note the format for backup-excludes. Everything preceded with a -
  is removed from the backup and everything preceded by a + is added to it, regardless
  what was listed in the excludes portion. Always list excludes first and includes
  below the _*, Also be aware that rsync will choke on stray whitespace at the end of a line.
  If using Geany, it may be helpful to turn Show Whitespace on.
- Be sure and exclude any directories that you mount sshfs shares to,
  unless you really want rsync descending into those shares and backing them up.
  For instance, I have an exclude for /home/tknomanzr/remote listed, which
  is where I mount my sshfs share to the same server that I am backing up too.
  Obviously, I don't want to back that up, as it hosts a ton of media and has its
  own backup methods in place.
