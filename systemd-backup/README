Dependencies:
ssh
sshpass
rsync
systemd

Useage:
copy systemd-backup.service and systemd-backup.timer to /etc/systemd/system
edit backup excludes and replace all the /home/ entries with your $HOME.
copy backup-excludes to ~/.config/backup
edit backup. Where it says "password" enter the password to your remote host.
Further down, enter the username and ip adress of your remote host.
Finally enter the path relative to your remote host that you want to backup to.
Copy this file to /usr/local/bin
Start systemd-backup.service and systemd-backup.timer
sudo systemctl start systemd-backup.timer
sudo systemctl start systemd-backup.service

Notes:
- Currently, sshpass is using a password in plain text. I am hoping to be able to
  implement some sort of hashing to obfucate that in the future.
- You can adjust the settings in systemd-backup.timer and set a lower value,
  say 5 minutes in order to verify that everything is working.
- Verify the service files are working via journalctl -f
- Note the format for backup0 excludes. Everything preceded with a -
  is removed from the backup and everything preceded by a + is added to it, regardless
  what was listed in the excludes portion. Always list excludes first and includes
  below the _*, Also be aware that rsync will choke on stray whitespace at the end of a line.
  If using Geany, it may be helpful to turn Show Whitespace on.
- Finally, I may eventually create an install script that will assist in setting everything up.
