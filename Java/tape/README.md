This is an implementation of a binary linked list as a tape that
can be as long as it wants on either end. This means that if the current
marker in the linked list is at the end of the list to either the left
or right, a new node is created. Iterating across it involves searching
for the null in whichever direction being iterated from.

This data structure took me awhile to figure out and implement, so I am
stashing it here for reference.
