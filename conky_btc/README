show_bitcoin is a simple python script that levarages information
from an electrum wallet, along with current bit coin pricing to
format and print out the amount of bitcoin in the wallet, the current
price for bitcoing and the current estimated fiat currency value of 
the bitcoin stored in the electrum wallet.

The current iteration of this script is in its early stages. At the 
moment is uses font1 & font2 as two variables that define the fonts and
colors formatted for output to conky.

TO DO: implement an arg parser to pass in the font arguments.

Useage: Assuming the script is stored in ~/bin then issue
${execpi 60 ~/bin/show_bitcoin}
into your conky. Output will be formatted for conky using values stored
in font1 & font2 in show_bitcoin
