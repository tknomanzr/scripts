USEAGE: clean-snapshots -k=num 
where -k is an integer representing the number of snapshots to keep
If no option is specified, all snapshots will be deleted. If you want to
reset your snapshot count, then run this script with no options and it
will delete all snapshots and reset your count back to 1.

This script can be run standalone or combined with the systemd files
snapshot-cleanup.service and snapshot-cleanup.timer to be run automatically.

The snapshot-cleanup.timer is currently set to run once per day.
snapshot-cleanup.service calls the script clean-snapshots from /usr/local/bin.
The default number of snapshots to keep specified in snapshot-cleanup.service
is set to keep the last two snapshots.

SETUP:
copy clean-snapshots to /usr/local/bin, then copy snapshot-cleanup.service
and snapshot-cleanup.timer to /etc/systemd/system
then:
sudo systemctl enable snapshot-cleanup.service
sudo systemctl enable snapshot-cleanup.timer
sudo systemctl start snapshot-cleanup.service
sudo systemctl start snapshot-cleanup.timer

DEPENDENCIES:
The script clean-snapshots depends on:
btrfs
snapper
apt-btrfs-snapper
The systemd unit files depend on systemd, of course.
