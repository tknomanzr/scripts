This will be a series of systemd files and scripts that will
allow auto-mounting of an sshfs share at boot time.

REQUIRED:
systemd
sshfs
ssh
fuse

Useage:

Edit this line in home-tknomanzr-remote.mount
What=HOST_or_IP:/path/to/share
Where=/path/to/mountpoint
to the hostname or IP of your ssh share. 
The part after the colon should be some valid path on the ssh server.
Also, be sure it is not a symlink of you will get an error about it not
being a directory when you attempt to start the service.

Next, be sure this IdentityFile=/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa points to the
ssh key that you want to connect with.

Be aware that automounting will not work if the ssh key has a password
set on it. If necessary, generate a new key with ssh-keygen and be sure
not to enter a password when prompted. Use ssh-copy-id to move it over
to your ssh server, like so:
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@ip
where id_rsa is the key you want to connect with.

copy these files to /etc/systemd/system:
sudo cp home-tknomanzr-remote.automount /etc/systemd/system
sudo cp home-tknomanzr-remote.mount /etc/systemd/system
sudo cp killsshds.service /etc/systemd/system

Now rename the home-tknomanzr-remote.automount and home-tknomanzr-remote.mount 
files to reflect the path you specified in the Where= directive in
/etc/systemd/system/home-tknomanzr-remote.mount
So for instance if you wanted to mount the sshfs share into /home/bob/Public
Where=/home/bob/Public
then:
sudo mv /etc/systemd/system/home-tknomanzr-remote.mount /etc/systemd/system/home-bob-Public.mount
similarly, rename the automount file:
sudo mv /etc/systemd/system/home-tknomanzr-remote.automount /etc/systemd/system/home-bob-Public.automount

Finally enable and start the services, you should use the files you specified 
with the mv commands above:
sudo systemctl enable your_mount.automount
sudo systemctl enable your_mount.mount
sudo systemdctl enable killsshfs.service

Then, see if the mount point will start:
sudo systemctl start your_mount.mount
